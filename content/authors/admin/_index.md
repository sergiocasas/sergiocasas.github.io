I am a Sr Staff Tech Lead Manager at <a href="https://waabi.ai/" target="_blank">Waabi</a>, where I lead our Perception and Behavior Reasoning team.
I completed my PhD at the University of Toronto supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/" target="_blank">Raquel Urtasun</a>. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.
