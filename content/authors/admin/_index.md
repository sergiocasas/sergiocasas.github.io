I am a Sr Staff Researcher and Tech Lead Manager at <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank">Waymo Research</a> working on Behavior Modeling for Self-Driving Cars. Previously, I led the Perception and Behavior Reasoning team at <a href="https://waabi.ai/" target="_blank">Waabi</a>, and before that I was a Research Scientist at <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Aurora-is-acquiring-Ubers-self-driving-unit-Advanced-Technologies-Group-accelerating-development-of-the-Aurora-Driver/default.aspx" target="_blank">Uber ATG</a>. I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/" target="_blank">University of Toronto CS department</a>, supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/" target="_blank">Raquel Urtasun</a> (thesis <a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/140889/1/Casas_Romero_Sergio_202411_PhD_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). I am excited about bringing AI to the physical world.
